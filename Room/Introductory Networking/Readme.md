## Task 1. Introduction
The aim of this room is to provide a beginner's introduction to the basic principles of networking. Networking is a massive topic, so this really will just be a brief overview; however, it will hopefully give you some foundational knowledge of the topic, which you can build upon for yourself.

The topics that we're going to cover in this room are:

* The OSI Model
* The TCP/IP Model
* How these models look in practice
* An introduction to basic networking tools

### Let's get started!
