# Room Introduction

The Phishing Pond is designed to build practical phishing-detection skills by exposing the learner to a series of email examples that mirror real social engineering attempts. The core objective of the lab is to evaluate each message and decide whether it is legitimate or part of a phishing campaign. The room reinforces the key indicators attackers rely on when crafting these emails.

The exercise highlights several common tactics. Urgency and scare-based subject lines push users into reacting without verifying the details. Look-alike sender addresses introduce subtle domain changes that resemble trusted brands. Display name impersonation makes the sender appear familiar even when the underlying email address is suspicious. Malicious attachments often disguise malware while encouraging the recipient to enable macros or open unsafe files. Some messages originate from compromised legitimate accounts, making them appear authentic while hiding harmful intent. Others use financial bait or unrealistic offers to lure victims into revealing personal information.

The lab’s purpose is to sharpen awareness of these patterns and strengthen the ability to analyze emails with precision. Each task reinforces how attackers disguise intent and how to identify those signals confidently.

I reached the main interface of the room and began working through the emails. Let’s dive into Level 1.
